# Consolidated Health Insurance Risk Adjustment Dataset - Synthetic Data Generated by AI for Demonstration Purposes
# This dataset combines member demographics, claims data, HCC codes, RAF scores, and provider performance metrics
# for use in Risk Adjustment Factor optimization, claims analysis, and Medicare Advantage revenue maximization. All data is artificial and AI-generated.
#
# Organization: Summit Health Analytics (Fictitious Medicare Advantage Plan)
# Dataset Purpose: Risk adjustment optimization, HCC coding accuracy, provider performance, and revenue capture
# Focus Areas: RAF score optimization, HCC hierarchy validation, EDPS compliance, coding gap identification
